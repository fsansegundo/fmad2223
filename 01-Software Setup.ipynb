    "+ A conda environment allows us to organize our work in projects, keeping each project dependencies isolated from the rest of your work. It is also the best way to avoid running into the potentially catastrophic situation in where you have several Python versions and they conflict to [create a mess](https://xkcd.com/1987/). We urge you to **always use environments** to organize your work in Python. You can learn more about the use of Conda environments [in this link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#). And to learn more about environments in Python in general, you can check these two links:\n",
