    "+ Every time you run or render the *last* cell of your notebook a new cell will be added below. If you need to insert more cells somewhere in the notebook you can use the *Insert* menu. But the keyboard shortcuts `A` and `B` can also be used to add new cells `A`bove or `B`elow the active cell. For this to work you need to be in command mode, to be explained in the next item.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ When using a Jupyter Notebook there is always an *active cell* which you can select with the mouse. The active cell (can be either code or markdown) is highlighted by a surrounding frame, and the color of frame indicates the *mode*:\n",
    "    + *Edit mode (green)*. The cursor blinks inside the cell and lets you modify the contents of the cell. That is, we use this mode to write code or markdown depending of the cell type.\n",
    "    + *Command mode (blue)*. This mode is used to operate on the contents of a cell as a whole. In this mode you can *run the code* in a code cell or you can *render the content* of a markdown cell. You can also use this mode to copy or move the cell, delete it, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ If you are in edit mode you can change to command mode hitting the `Esc` key (or clicking with your mouse outside the active cell). If you are in command mode you can change to edit mode with the `Enter` &#9166; key (or clicking inside the cell, double-click if it is not the active cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ To run or render the content of the cell:\n",
    "    + Make sure the cell is active (the mode is irrelevant).\n",
    "    + Use the key combination Shift + Enter (&#8679; + &#9166;)\n",
    "  If the cell contains Python code it will be executed. Keep in mind that if the code in that cell depends on the results of previous cells then they must also be executed beforehand. There are some useful options in the *Cell* menu of the notebook interface that will help you run the required parts of the notebook.\n",

    "+ Markdown is a very simple markup language that we use to modify the aspect of the text. For example, to make a sentence *render in italic* you just need to surround it with asterisks. And markdown is not specific of Jupyter notebooks. In fact its support is increasing as a basic tool for text formatting in many technical contexts. Learning the basics of markdown is a good idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ We recommend to open the source file of this or any other of the course Jupyter notebooks and look at some of the markdown cells (remember, use edit mode) to see how markdown was used to include sectioning commands (sections, subsections), figures, links, bullet lists, etc. If you know how to write $\\LaTeX$ ([you can get a first impression here](https://ashki23.github.io/markdown-latex.html#latex)) you can use it to include nice mathematical equations in your markdown cells:\n",

    "By the way, the above result plays an important role in the normal distribution that we will be discussing soon.  \n",
    " *Note for Latex users.* you don't need a separate installation of LaTeX to use it in Jupyter notebooks, as it is provided by your browser through MathJax.\n",
