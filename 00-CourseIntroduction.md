## Course Description

+ This course is a primer in Statistics with a special emphasis on its mathematical foundations. The subject aims to introduce the student to the language of Statistics and to basic, but fundamental, concepts such as distributions, probability inference and statistical models. Our approach is practical and conceptual, using the computational tools as a mean to gain an insight into the central ideas of Statistics.

+ The subject also provides a first course of the Python language by combining exposure of the main concepts in Statistics and tutorial Python sessions. Our focus will be in a modern but well established flavor of the Python language using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn and Seaborn to describe the data analysis steps as a workflow.

+ We will also introduce some auxiliary tools that form an important part of the Python data analysis ecosystem. Git and GitHub have become a natural setting for collaborative work and communication inside a team.

+ The basic structure of the Data Analysis process is, according to Wickham and Grolemund (2016) this one:

We will learn how to use the foundational Python Data Science toolkit to follow all the steps of this process. 

+ This is the well known [Drew Conway's Diagram of Data Science](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram):  
<img src='./fig/Data_Science_VD.png' style= 'width:120mm'>  
We will be exploring the upper part of this diagram, to provide you with the skills that you will need in other courses. 
  
+ The original Conway diagram warns about a danger zone that Data Science practitioners should avoid. But there is a second danger zone for Machine Learning applicatyions that you must be aware of, well illustrated by this [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1831) cartoon:

## Software Setup and Previous Versions of the Code and Course Slides

+ Previous versions of this course used the R language. You can find the course slides for the last version at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mbdfmad/fmad2122). Python was chosen this year to meet the requirements of other courses in the MBD. But R is a very useful language to add to your data science toolbox and portfolio. We encourage you to take a look at the R material for this course 

+ We have prepared software setup instructions for:
    + [Windows users](01-Software_Setup_Windows_Version.ipynb)
    + [MacOS users](01M-Software_Setup_MacOS_Version.ipynb)
    
  If you are planning to use Linux for this course please let us know.
